"""Make the eval-harness venv's third-party deps importable.

Imported (as the first line) by every skill script and by score.py/report.py.

The venv at ``<plugin_root>/.eval-venv`` contains ONLY third-party deps — the
``agent_eval`` package itself is always resolved from the source tree via
PYTHONPATH. So the DEFAULT and correct action is to put the venv's
site-packages on ``sys.path`` of the running interpreter: no process
replacement, fully re-entrant, safe under pytest and under
``importlib.util.exec_module`` (how run.py loads report.py / score.py by path).

We re-exec into the venv interpreter via ``os.execv`` ONLY in the single case
where ``sys.path`` patching is insufficient AND re-exec is safe:

  * INSUFFICIENT: the running interpreter's ABI (major.minor) differs from the
    venv's, so the venv's compiled wheels (cpXY ``.so`` files) cannot be
    imported under the running interpreter.
  * SAFE: this is a genuine top-level *script* entry (``python script.py``),
    detected via ``__main__.__spec__ is None`` — so the re-exec happens at
    import time, before the script does any work. ``python -m`` yields a
    non-None ``__spec__`` and ``-c``/exec_module are likewise excluded, because
    re-exec there would either re-run ``__main__`` after side effects (the
    duplicate-run bug) or have no script to re-run.

The env-var sentinel makes activation idempotent and survives ``os.execv``
(env is inherited by the new process image), so the re-exec'd process
short-circuits instead of looping.
