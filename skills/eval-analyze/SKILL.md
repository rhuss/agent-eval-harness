name: eval-analyze
description: Generate eval.yaml for the agent eval harness. Supports two evaluation modes - (1) Skill-based - deeply examines skills (SKILL.md, sub-skills, scripts, test cases) to test if implementations work correctly, OR (2) Prompt-based - uses custom analysis prompts to test agent capabilities directly (documentation effectiveness, pattern understanding, API usage, constraint compliance). Produces complete evaluation config — execution mode, dataset schema, output descriptions, judges, models, and thresholds. Use this whenever someone wants to evaluate a skill, test agent capabilities, add quality checks, validate documentation, benchmark performance, or just created a new skill/documentation and needs eval infrastructure. Also triggered automatically by /eval-run when eval.yaml is missing. Even casual questions like "how do I know if my skill/docs are working?" trigger this skill.

You generate `eval.yaml` — the configuration that `/eval-run` needs. You either:

1. **Analyze a skill** (default): Read the skill deeply (including sub-skills), explore test cases, generate config for testing the skill
2. **Custom analysis** (`--prompt`): Execute a custom analysis prompt that defines what to evaluate and how

The core principle: **observe, don't assume**. Every field name, file pattern, and directory path in the generated eval.yaml must come from reading actual files. If you can't point to a specific file or field you observed, don't put it in the config.

## Step 0: Parse Arguments and Discover Layout

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--skill <name>` | no | auto-detect | Which skill to analyze |
| `--config <path>` | no | auto-discover | Output path for the config |
| `--prompt <path>` | no | none | Custom analysis prompt (for non-skill evals) |
| `--update` | no | false | Fill in missing sections only, preserve user edits |

```bash
mkdir -p tmp
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/agent_eval/state.py init tmp/analyze-config.yaml \
  skill=<skill> prompt=<prompt> config=<config> update=<true/false>
```

### Config Location Discovery

If `--config` was explicitly provided, use that path directly (skip discovery).

Otherwise, discover existing eval configs:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/discover.py
```

Based on discovery results:
- **No configs found**: scaffold `eval.yaml` at the project root (simple default for first eval)
- **One root config exists** and `--skill` targets a different eval than the existing one: offer to reorganize into `eval/` layout. If the user accepts, run the reorganization script (see Phase 7). If declined, ask where to put the new config.
- **Nested/flat layout already exists**: place the new config at `eval/<skill-name>/eval.yaml` (nested) or alongside existing flat configs
- **`--config` provided**: use the explicit path, bypass layout logic

Set the resolved config path as `<config>` for all subsequent steps. Set `<eval_md_path>` to the same directory as `<config>`, with filename `eval.md`.

**Analysis modes**:

1. **Skill analysis** (default): Analyze a skill's implementation
   ```bash
   /eval-analyze --skill my-skill
   ```
   Generates `execution.mode: case` or `batch` config

2. **Prompt-based analysis**: Generate eval config from a custom analysis prompt
   ```bash
   # Use builtin documentation analysis prompt
   /eval-analyze --prompt builtin:docs
   
   # Use custom analysis prompt
   /eval-analyze --prompt path/to/analysis-prompt.md
   ```
   Generates config with `execution.prompt` (prompt mode)

**Builtin prompts**:
- `builtin:docs` → Analyze repository documentation structure and generate taxonomy-based eval config

## Step 1: Determine Analysis Mode

Check arguments and repository contents to decide which mode to use:

**If `--skill` provided**: Go to Step 2 (skill analysis)

**If `--prompt` provided**: Go to Step 2-Prompt (custom prompt analysis)

**If neither provided**: Detect what's available and choose mode

1. **Check for skills**:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/find_skills.py
   ```

2. **Check for agentic documentation**:
   ```bash
   HAS_DOCS=false
   if [ -f CLAUDE.md ] || [ -f AGENTS.md ] || [ -d ai-docs ]; then
       HAS_DOCS=true
   fi
   ```

3. **Present options based on what exists**:
   - **Both skills and docs exist**: Ask user which mode via AskUserQuestion:
     - "Skill-based evaluation (test specific skill implementation)"
     - "Documentation evaluation (test if agents can use your agentic docs)"
   - **Only skills exist**: Auto-select skill mode, proceed to Step 2
   - **Only docs exist**: Auto-select prompt mode with `builtin:docs`, proceed to Step 2-Prompt
   - **Neither exists**: Error - "No skills or agentic documentation found. Create a skill in `skills/` or add CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/ai-docs/ for documentation testing."

---

## SKILL ANALYSIS (Default)

### Step 2: Find the Target Skill

If `--skill` was provided, locate its SKILL.md:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/find_skills.py --name <skill>
```

If not provided, list all project skills:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/find_skills.py
```

This reads `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for custom skill paths, falls back to `.claude/skills/` and `skills/`, and excludes eval harness skills. If only one skill is found, use it automatically. If multiple, ask the user which to analyze. If none are found, tell the user — they may need to check their skill directory paths or create a skill first.

**If `--update` and eval.yaml already has a `skill` field**: use that skill. If `--skill` is also provided and differs, ask the user which they mean — don't silently overwrite.

## Step 3: Check If Analysis Is Needed

If the resolved `<config>` already exists and `--update` was not set:

```bash
test -f <config> && echo "CONFIG_EXISTS" || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

If it exists, validate it:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_eval.py config <config>
```

Then check if eval.md (the cached analysis) is still fresh — meaning the SKILL.md hasn't changed since the last analysis:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_eval.py memory <eval_md_path>
```

If FRESH and eval.yaml has a non-empty `dataset.schema`, at least one `outputs` entry with a schema, at least one judge, and `models.skill` set, report that config is up to date and exit. No work needed. (An INCOMPLETE config — empty sections, or missing `models.skill` from a pre-restructure eval.yaml — still needs analysis.)

If STALE, NO_CONFIG, or `--update` was set, proceed to full analysis.

## Step 4: Deep-Read the Skill

This is the most important step — the quality of everything downstream depends on how thoroughly you understand the skill.

Launch an Explore agent to do the analysis:

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/analyze-skill.md` to get the analysis instructions
2. Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type="Explore"`
3. Pass as prompt: the contents of analyze-skill.md, with the actual skill path prepended (e.g., "Analyze the skill at .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md. <rest of analyze-skill.md>")

The analysis is **recursive** — the agent follows sub-skill chains (Skill tool calls, `/skill-name` references) until it finds the skills that produce the final artifacts (typically 2-5 levels, capped at 5 to avoid circular references), reading each sub-skill's SKILL.md to trace the full pipeline. The outputs section must describe what the entire pipeline produces, not just the top-level orchestrator.

The agent returns structured YAML with: purpose, inputs, outputs, sub_skills, flags, pipeline, quality_criteria, and suggested_judges. See `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/analyze-skill.md` for the full schema.

**Verify the response**: check that outputs reference actual directories and file patterns (not placeholders like `<output-dir>`), that sub_skills lists real skill names, and that suggested_judges include working code snippets. If anything looks fabricated, ask the agent to re-examine specific files.

## Step 5: Explore the Dataset

First check if eval.yaml already has a `dataset.path` (from a previous run or `--update`):

```bash
ls <dataset_path>/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

If not set or doesn't exist, search the project (relative to `<config>` directory) for test case directories using the Glob tool:

```
Glob: **/cases/ or **/test-cases/ or **/fixtures/ or **/examples/ or **/dataset/ or **/eval/ or **/tests/data/
```

Exclude `.venv/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/` from results.

If nothing found, ask the user where their test cases are (or will be).

If a cases directory exists, read **one complete sample case** — every file in it. Note:
- File names and formats (YAML, JSON, markdown, etc.)
- Field names and their purposes
- Which files are inputs vs references/gold standards
- Any metadata or annotations

This is what you'll describe in `dataset.schema`. If you didn't read the actual files, your schema description will be wrong — and downstream judges will fail because they expect fields that don't exist.

If no test cases exist, note this clearly and suggest running `/eval-dataset` to generate them. Describe the expected case structure in `dataset.schema` anyway — eval-dataset uses that description to create matching cases.

## Step 6: Generate eval.yaml

Combine the skill analysis (Step 4) and dataset exploration (Step 5) into a complete eval.yaml. Read the full template and writing guidance at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/eval-yaml-template.md`.

Key points:
- **Execution mode**: use the `execution.mode` from the skill analysis (Step 4). If the analyzer returned `ASK_USER`, ask the user which mode to use — explain what the analyzer observed and let them decide. Do not default to `case` without evidence; a skill that processes collections of items internally (batch-size controls, multi-item iteration, multi-agent fan-out, result aggregation) is `batch` even if it also accepts a single item. See `eval-yaml-template.md` for the full mode selection guidance.
- **Arguments template**: under `execution.arguments`. For `case` mode, build a template with `{field}` placeholders matching the input.yaml fields you observed in Step 5 (e.g., `"{strat_key} {adr_file?}"`). For `batch` mode, use the literal arguments string (e.g., `"--input batch.yaml --headless"`).
- **Runner**: `runner.type: claude-code` is the default and almost always correct. Only change it if the user has explicitly mentioned another harness.
- **Models**: set `models.skill` to `claude-opus-4-6` (the default for eval runs). Set `models.judge` to `claude-opus-4-6` — LLM and pairwise judges need a strong model for accurate scoring. If the skill uses AskUserQuestion interactively (not `--headless`), set `models.hook` to `claude-sonnet-4-6` for LLM-based question answering (fast enough for picking options, cheaper than Opus). CLI flags override.
- **MLflow**: set `mlflow.experiment` to `<project>-eval` (or leave blank — it falls back to the top-level `name`).
- The `dataset.schema` and `outputs[*].schema` fields drive the entire pipeline — be specific, reference actual file/field names you observed
- **External-state fields**: if the skill analysis (Step 4) identified input fields that reference external systems (Jira project keys, GitHub repos, API endpoints via MCP tools or env vars like `JIRA_SERVER`), annotate those fields in `dataset.schema` with `[EXTERNAL: System]` markers (e.g., `'project_key' ([EXTERNAL: Jira] — must be a real project key)`). This tells `/eval-dataset` not to fabricate values for these fields. See `eval-yaml-template.md` for the convention.
- **Permissions**: if the skill's `allowed-tools` frontmatter includes `Skill` (meaning it invokes sub-skills), add `"Skill"` to `permissions.allow`. The Skill tool requires explicit permission in headless mode — without it, nested skill calls fail silently and the pipeline degrades. **IMPORTANT**: For skill-based evaluations, do NOT add `deny` rules — the skill runs in an isolated workspace. Deny rules are ONLY for prompt-mode evaluations (where the agent works in-repo and you need to prevent test cheating).
- **Environment variables**: if the skill needs external service credentials (e.g., `JIRA_SERVER` for a jira-emulator, API keys for test instances), add `execution.env` entries. Use `$VAR` syntax for values that should be resolved from the caller's environment (e.g., `$JIRA_TOKEN`), or literal values for test-only endpoints (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
- If the skill uses AskUserQuestion, calls external services (MCP tools), or runs scripts that interact with APIs, add `inputs.tools` entries. Use `match` to describe what to intercept in natural language (e.g., "any Jira interaction via MCP or scripts"), and `prompt` for how to handle it. The AskUserQuestion hook uses 3-tier answer resolution: exact match from `case_overrides`, then an LLM call (using `models.hook`) with the case's `input.yaml` and `answers.yaml` as context, then fallback to the first option. If the skill asks domain-specific questions (e.g., "is this a duplicate?"), suggest the user create `answers.yaml` files per case with guidance for the LLM answerer.
- **Annotation-aware judges**: judges receive `outputs["annotations"]` — the parsed `annotations.yaml` from the dataset case. Use this for outcome-aware scoring where the expected result depends on the test case (e.g., `annotations.get("dedup_is_duplicate")` determines whether producing no output is correct).
- **Prefer builtin judges for common patterns** — the harness ships reusable judges in `agent_eval/judges/`. Use `builtin:` instead of writing inline code. Discover available builtins: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/list_builtins.py`. See the template for examples.
- **Parameterize with `arguments:`** — all judge types support an `arguments:` dict. Use it instead of hardcoding values in check code or prompt text. For inline checks, `arguments` is passed as the second parameter. For LLM prompts, use `{{ arguments.key }}` (Jinja2 rendered).
- Aim for 1-2 `builtin` judges + 2-3 inline `check` judges + 1-2 LLM `prompt` judges. Start lean.
- **Reward composition (optional)** — if the analyzer returned a `suggested_reward` and the eval has multiple judges, add a `reward:` section to eval.yaml so the report's Reward column *and* Harbor's `reward.json` reflect the intended composition (single-judge / weighted / formula, with optional gate). Without a `reward:` section, both fall back to a default resolution (gate on any false boolean judge + average of numerics normalized on [1,5]) that can silently disagree with what you'd hand-compute. See `eval-yaml-template.md` for the full reward schema, including the "gate on every boolean" caveat.
- **Portability** — keep `dataset.path` and `outputs[*].path` project-relative. Absolute paths work locally but break under Harbor / EvalHub, which containerize execution with different filesystem roots.
- If `--update`: preserve everything already in the file, only add missing top-level keys (e.g., add a `models:` block if the user is upgrading from an older config that lacked it). Also check LLM judge prompts for literal `{{ }}` that isn't a template variable — all prompts are Jinja2 rendered.

## Step 6b: Validate Generated Config

After writing eval.yaml to the resolved `<config>` path, validate that all references are correct:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_eval.py config <config>
```

This checks dataset path exists (resolved relative to the config file's directory), output paths are relative, judge prompt_file/context/module references resolve, and runner.settings exists.

**Errors** (exit code 1): fix before proceeding — broken file references, absolute paths, missing modules.

**Warnings** (exit code 0): may be expected — empty dataset (user hasn't created cases yet), missing judges (will be added later). Report them to the user but don't block.

## Step 7: Generate eval.md

The eval.md caches the skill analysis so it doesn't need to be repeated. Write it to `<eval_md_path>` (same directory as the config file). The hash tracks only the top-level SKILL.md — if sub-skills change, the user should run `/eval-analyze --update` to refresh. Compute the skill hash:

```bash
python3 -c "import hashlib; from pathlib import Path; print(hashlib.sha256(Path('<skill-path>/SKILL.md').read_bytes()).hexdigest()[:12])"
```

Read the template at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/generate-eval-md.md`. Write eval.md with YAML frontmatter (skill, analyzed_at, skill_hash) and a markdown narrative of the analysis.

## Step 8: Report

Tell the user what was generated:

- **eval.yaml**: created/updated — N judges configured, dataset at `<path>` (M cases found)
- **eval.md**: skill analysis cached (hash: `<hash>`)
- **Next steps**:
  - If no test cases found: `/eval-dataset` to generate test cases (required before eval-run)
  - If test cases exist: `/eval-run --model <model>` to execute the evaluation

If validation produced warnings, list them so the user knows what's incomplete.

## Rules

- **Read before you write** — every field name and file pattern in eval.yaml must come from reading actual files, not from templates or assumptions
- **Schema descriptions must be specific** — "input.yaml with a 'prompt' field" is good. "Input files" is useless. If you can't be specific, you didn't read the files.
- **Generate working judges** — inline check scripts must be valid Python. LLM prompts must define what each score level means.
- **Preserve user work** — when updating, diff carefully. User-modified judges, schema descriptions, and thresholds should be kept.
- **Fail loudly** — if the skill analysis is incomplete or the dataset can't be found, say so. Don't generate a config full of placeholders.

## PROMPT-BASED ANALYSIS (Custom)

### Step 2-Prompt: Generate Eval Config from Analysis Prompt

**Objective**: Generate `eval.yaml` using a custom analysis prompt that defines what to evaluate and how.

This is for non-skill evaluations where you want to test agent capabilities directly:
- **Skill eval**: "Does this skill work correctly?"
- **Prompt eval**: "Can an agent accomplish X given Y context?"

#### Resolve Prompt Path

If `--prompt` starts with `builtin:`, resolve to builtin prompt:

```bash
# builtin:docs → ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/analyze-docs.md
```

Otherwise treat as a file path (absolute or relative to project root).

#### Launch Analysis Agent

1. **Resolve the prompt path**:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_prompt.py <prompt-ref>
```

This resolves `builtin:docs` → `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/analyze-docs.md` or validates custom paths.

2. **Read the analysis prompt**:
```bash
cat <resolved-prompt-path>
```

3. **Launch Explore agent** with the prompt content:

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type="Explore"` and pass the analysis prompt as the task. The prompt defines:
- What to analyze (documentation, code patterns, APIs, etc.)
- What test categories to generate
- What domain knowledge to extract
- What judges to configure
- What traces to capture

Example invocation:
```python
Agent(
  description="Analyzing repository for eval config generation",
  subagent_type="Explore",
  prompt=<prompt-content>
)
```

The agent explores the repository following the prompt instructions and returns a complete `eval.yaml` configuration in YAML format.

4. **Extract the generated config**:

The agent's response should contain the eval.yaml content. Extract it and write to the config file path (default: `eval.yaml`, or value from `--config` argument).

5. **Write eval.yaml**:
```bash
# Write the generated config
Write(config_path, generated_yaml_content)
```

**Note**: The builtin `docs` prompt (`prompts/analyze-docs.md`) analyzes repository documentation and generates evaluation config with taxonomy-based test categories, domain knowledge, and documentation tracking. See `analyze-docs.md` for implementation details.

#### Validation

Validate the generated config (use the --config path from Step 0):

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_eval.py config <config_path>
```

Replace `<config_path>` with the actual value from the --config argument (default: eval.yaml).

Check for:
- `execution.prompt` is set (prompt mode)
- Required fields are populated
- File paths resolve correctly

#### Next Steps

Tell the user:

- **eval.yaml**: created from `<prompt-name>` analysis
- **Execution mode**: case (one invocation per test case)
- **What to execute**: Direct prompt (`execution.prompt`)
- **Test structure**: {summary of test_categories or schema}
- **Next steps**:
  1. Review generated config
  2. Generate test cases: `/eval-dataset --config eval.yaml`
  3. Run evaluation: `/eval-run --model sonnet --config eval.yaml`

## Analysis Type Comparison

| Aspect | Skill Analysis | Prompt-Based Analysis |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Invocation** | `/eval-analyze --skill my-skill` | `/eval-analyze --prompt builtin:docs` |
| **Analyzes** | SKILL.md, scripts, sub-skills | Whatever the prompt specifies |
| **What to execute** | `execution.skill` (skill invocation) | `execution.prompt` (direct prompt) |
| **Execution mode** | `case` or `batch` | `case` |
| **Dataset** | Schema-based (input/output fields) | Prompt-defined (often taxonomy-based) |
| **Judges** | Skill-specific (output quality) | Prompt-defined (capability checks) |
| **Domain config** | Usually empty | Prompt-defined (see Step 3 in prompts/analyze-docs.md) |
| **Use case** | "Does my skill work?" | "Can agents do X?" |
